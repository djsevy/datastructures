# Data Structures

Welcometo my data structures tutorial! My goal is to give a basic understanding of these three data structures:

 - [Stacks](stacks.md)
 - [Linked Lists](linkedlists.md)
 - [Trees](trees.md)

  We will review why they are useful, how efficient they are and what Big O is applicable. After reviewing these data structures, I will give an example of how to use them. Once I've completed said example, I will then give the viewer a challenge to complete.

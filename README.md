# Data Structures

Welcometo my data structures tutorial! My goal is to give a basic understanding of these three data structures:

 - [Stacks](stacks.md)
 - [Linked Lists](linkedlists.md)
 - [Trees](trees.md)

  We will review why they are useful, how efficient they are and what Big O is applicable. After reviewing these data structures, I will give an example of how to use them. Once I've completed said example, I will then give the viewer a challenge to complete. 
        
Below are the links to the python files with the code we will be using as well as the files for the pictures that will help illustrate the topics we will discuss.
